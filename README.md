# Symfony DDD Clean Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate designed to accelerate the setup of new projects using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**,
**Hexagonal/Clean Architecture**, and **Symfony**. It avoids the "screaming architecture" of traditional Symfony folder
structures and provides a robust foundation for high-quality, maintainable code.
